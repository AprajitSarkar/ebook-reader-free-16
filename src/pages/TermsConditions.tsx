          When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current

          of these Terms will remain in effect.
        </p>

          material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes 
          a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
        </p>
